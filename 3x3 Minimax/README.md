# Minimax 3x3 Tic Tac Toe

An implementation of Minimax AI Algorithm on 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe. Original implementation done by Clederson Cruz: https://github.com/Cledersonbc/tic-tac-toe-minimax

The original source code was adapted so two AIs play against one another (instead of AI vs. human), each using the minimax algorithm to traverse the game state tree depending on the current state of the board. Based on 100 simulated AI vs. AI games, the game ends in a draw 100% of the time. This indicates that the two AIs are performing optimally against one another using the minimax algorithm to inform their next move.
