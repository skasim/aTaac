functions.py contains the functions needed to train/test the model and play games.

train_model.py is used to set the epochs/batch size of the neural network for training. 1000 games are also simluated and the win/loss/draw statistics are presented alongside validation accuracy as a function of the number of epochs.

test_model.py is used to play games (AI vs. AI). User must specify which model to use for both AIs (one model is used for both).
